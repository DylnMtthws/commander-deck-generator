"""Deck builder orchestrator (D6.2, restructured for synergy optimizer).

Two preliminary steps run before the pipeline proper and are not counted as
stages: request validation, and commander profile acquisition (which may make
an LLM call and is billed). build() times them as metrics 1_validate and
2_profile.

Eight stages, listed as build() runs them. The labels match the inline
``# --- Stage`` comments; the numbering is historical rather than contiguous,
which is why 4.5 and 7b appear and why 5 and 6 share an entry:

1.   Hard filters + role tag loading
2.   Structural scoring + Pareto filter (remove dominated cards per role)
3.   Template derivation (profile-driven composition)
4.   Infrastructure fill (4 deterministic generators)
4.5  Empirical staple reservation -- consensus engine pieces the role scorers
     reject. Occupies differentiator slots, so greedy fills that many fewer
     and the deck still totals 99.
5+6  Synergy optimization, all inside _optimize_differentiators:
     role targets -> synergy matrix -> greedy fill -> swap refinement ->
     budget rebalancing (the step older comments call stage 7) ->
     engine-floor repair -> LLM safety vet.
     The vet is one batched call and is the final gate: it runs last within
     this stage precisely so nothing bypasses it.
7b.  Enforce Commander legality (exactly 99, singleton, in color identity)
8.   Synthesis + classify + persist

Note for anyone renumbering this: the stage labels are inconsistent elsewhere
in the codebase -- staple reservation is called 4.5 at line 905 but 3.5 at
line 1202 and in tests/test_empirical_reserve.py. Fixing that is a wider
change than this docstring.

# Per-variant empirical Pareto protection: a card in >= MIN_INCLUSION of the
# target variant's real decks is shielded from price-domination outright.
#
# Protection deliberately does NOT depend on how the dominator compares. An
# earlier version also required the dominator to be some margin rarer, on the
# theory that domination picks between substitutes and the corpus should break
# the tie. That is the wrong model: real decks run Pitiless Plunderer (65%) AND
# Deadly Dispute (55%) together. Cards that co-occur in most real decks are
# complements, so the margin between them is always small -- which meant the
# protection could never fire for the staples it existed to protect. Measured
# on Korvold, every one of the 6 eliminated staples was killed by another card
# from the same corpus, gaps ranging +0.02 to +0.18.
#
# The card's own inclusion rate is the whole signal: if it is in 65% of the
# variant's real decks, the corpus has already said it earns a slot. Only 68 of
# 1154 scored cards clear 0.30, so the exempt set stays small.
