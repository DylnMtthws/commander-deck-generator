"""Synergy-aware greedy deck optimizer.

Two-phase optimization:
1. Greedy fill — select cards by marginal contribution to the deck
2. Swap refinement — improve deck by swapping cards if objective improves

Cards are evaluated by how they interact with cards already in the deck,
not independently. The deck_objective function measures deck-level quality
across synergy density, role coverage, average CVAR, and curve coherence.

    Price is a constraint, not a quality signal, so this pass is where the
    budget actually gets managed. Three move types, all judged by the same
    deck-objective gain:

      1. Upgrade (spend-down): while budget remains, apply the best 1-for-1
         quality upgrades. Stops when the best available gain falls below
         ``rebalance_min_gain`` -- leftover budget then means the market had
         nothing left worth buying, which is a legitimate outcome (unspent
         budget is real money, not waste).
      2. Unbundle (sell-one-buy-many): each of the most expensive cards must
         prove its price. Its contribution (objective with it vs with its
         best cheap substitute) is compared against what its freed dollars
         buy as upgrades spread across other slots. If splitting the money
         wins, the package is committed. This is what makes power-seeking
         greedy safe: an early expensive pick is reversible once it is clear
         the money serves the deck better elsewhere.
      3. Downgrade (safety net): if the deck somehow exceeds budget, shed
         cost with minimum objective loss.

    Args:
        deck: Current assignments (all slots).
        candidates: Full candidate pool.
        synergy: Precomputed synergy matrix.
        role_targets: Role targets for the objective.
        budget: Total deck budget in USD.
        template: Template for curve coherence in the objective.
        profile_signals: Profile signals for alignment in the objective.
        protected_names: Names never touched (staples, auto-includes).
